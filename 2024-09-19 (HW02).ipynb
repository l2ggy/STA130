    "Upon being shown the extension code, by chatgpt understood the purpose of the code perfectly. These are some excerpts from its answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"The extension code you provided enhances the original Markov chain model by considering word pairs (bigrams) instead of single words when predicting the next word.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"This code extends the Markovian chatbot by incorporating character-specific modeling. It builds separate second-order Markov chain models for each character in the dataset, allowing the chatbot to generate text that mimics the speech patterns of individual characters.\"*\n",

    "I mostly understood the code already, prior to asking chatgpt to explain it; however, I did find its explanations to be very clear and accurate, although somewhat inconcise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having worked with chatgpt previously, my biggest concern was trying to solve situations where the chatbot is giving wrong information or making a mistake, as it's very difficult to make it correct itself. It seems incapable of really understanding what it is that it is doing wrong; however, I've found the latest chatgpt models to make very few mistakes, and as such have had no experience in trying to troubleshoot its responses.\n",

    "I think now more than ever chatbots are extremely helpful in writing and trying to understand code.\n",

    "7) \n",
    "Since I've started the course and used ChatGPT more to deepen my understanding of technical concepts such as markov chains today, I've been impressed with its ability to explain code in detail and write code that is functioning and efficient.\n",

    "You shared an extension of the chatbot code and asked what it's supposed to do.\n",
    "I explained that the extension enhances the model to a second-order Markov chain by using word pairs (bigrams) to predict the next word, capturing more context for more coherent text generation.\n",
    "Second Extension Incorporating Character Modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "You provided another code extension and asked for its purpose.\n",
    "I detailed how this code adds character-specific modeling, creating separate bigram models for each character to generate text that mimics individual speaking styles.\n",
    "Discussion on Essential Skills in Data Science:\n",
    "\n",
    "You wanted to discuss the relevance of learning and adaptability, communication, coding, and statistics and data analysis as essential skills in the modern world, particularly in the data science industry.\n",

    "Possibility of Being a Statistician or Data Scientist Without Coding:\n",
    "\n",
    "You asked if one could be a statistician or data scientist without coding or doing data analysis.\n",
